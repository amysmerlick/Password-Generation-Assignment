# _**Introduction**_
***
We have been assigned the task of modiying starter code in order to create a random password generator. This app features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. The generator will ask you a series of questions of criteria required to create the password along with the desired length. It will tell you that it must be between 8 and 128 characters.This will generate a random password based off of your responses.
